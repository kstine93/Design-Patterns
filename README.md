# Design Patterns

This repo holds example code and documentation about programming 'design patterns'.
This is inspired by the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Gamma, Helm, Johnson and Vlissides.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to help me (and others maybe) to practice implementing these design patterns and thereby cement my understanding of them.

## Structure
Each design pattern holds its own subdirectory where specific examples and documentation are held.
